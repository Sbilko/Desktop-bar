# Desktop-bar
VTM is awesome 
Hi Dmitry sir I'm a huge fan of your VTM Terminal Multiplexer, I've been thinking about the Terminal Desktop Environment for months and collecting the terminal programs that could form a complete Desktop Environment.

your Terminal Multiplexer is the best and most easy and convenient to use out of the box 
I couldn't get it to work on Termux (the Android Linux Terminal) though, so for Termux I use tmux with the mouse option enabled (or GNU screen). 

your VTM looks incredibly cool on Windows, with the transparency it looks very fancy, useful and convenient ðŸ˜Š 

I think that it's really cool to set up all the basic tools one could need for a Terminal Desktop Environment with a single Command Line script, so I have been thinkering with such a script pipeline. 

For Termux (Android 5+): apt update && apt upgrade && apt install tmux nano mc elinks htop man ncdu ncdu2 wget git zsh && git clone https://github.com/sbilko/sbilko && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zimfw/install/master/install.zsh | zsh && chsh -s zsh

I think that a complete Terminal Desktop Environment is cool, 
to this day only GNU Emacs have something like that (though I find Emacs keybindings to be unconventional, and thus offputting for newcomers, I like the ergonomics-mode) 
Though this guy had put together a complete Terminal Desktop Environment years ago in the Gnome Terminal:

A Terminal Desktop Environment wouldn't be complete without a complete Desktop bar.
